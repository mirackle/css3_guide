  <p>
    This is the text the wraps around the floated image.
    You usually want to add a small right and bottom margin to the image so that
    the text does not tuoch it. Once the text passes the bottom of the image it 
    returns to its normal state and flows full width across its parent element.
    The text border is dispayed red here to show that only the text reflows.The
    element box behaves as if the image is not there at all.
